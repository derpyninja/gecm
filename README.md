**G**ames in support of **E**cosystem **C**risis **M**anagement (gecm)
======================================================================

A student project implemented by Martina, Marco, Lena, Ella-Mona and Felix as 
part of a *ETH Zurich graduate course* in [Foundations of Ecosystem Management](https://ecology.ethz.ch/education/master-courses/foundations-of-ecosystem-management.html).

Description
===========

Please follow the steps outlined [here](https://pypi.org/project/PyScaffold) if you want to co-develop the package.

The main bulk of the game development will probably take place using *numpy* and *tkinter*.
We could also try to leverage the following packages:

- [game2dboard](https://pypi.org/project/game2dboard)
- [pyGameMath](https://github.com/AlexMarinescu/pyGameMath)


Note
====

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.2.3. For details and usage
