**G**ames in support of **E**cosystem **C**risis **M**anagement (gecm)
======================================================================

Welcome to our student project on **G**ames in support of **E**cosystem **C**risis **M**anagement. 
This repository was created as part of [Foundations of Ecosystem Management](https://ecology.ethz.ch/education/master-courses/foundations-of-ecosystem-management.html), 
a graduate-level course offered at **ETH Zurich** in the autumn semester of 2020. 
The team members are Martina, Marco, Lena, Ella-Mona and Felix.


Description
===========

If you want to co-develop the package, please follow the steps outlined [here](https://pypi.org/project/PyScaffold). 
In addition, [this blogpost](https://florianwilhelm.info/2018/11/working_efficiently_with_jupyter_lab/)
is an excellent entry point for learning how to organise your code well, especially
in view of using *jupyter notebooks* within *jupyter lab*.

The main bulk of the game development will probably be done using *numpy* and *tkinter*.
We could also try to leverage the following packages:

- [game2dboard](https://pypi.org/project/game2dboard)
- [pyGameMath](https://github.com/AlexMarinescu/pyGameMath)


Note
====

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.2.3. For details and usage
